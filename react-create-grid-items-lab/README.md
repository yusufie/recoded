# React first lab

## Overview

The best thing about React is how React-ive it is. In this lab you will create the following image that contains the same component and use it 3 times. Obviously, since they are the same components their contents will be the same so don't worry about that unless you're going after the bonus.

## Instructions

1. Create a new component called `<CardList>` that uses grid or flexbox to show the 3 cards next to each other.
2. Create a component called `<Card>` that contains a title, description, and a button. Style the component exactly like the image. You can use classes or styles to do that.
3. Use the `<Card>` component 3 times in the `<CardList>`
4. BONUS: Can make some changes to the `<Card>` component so the content can be changeable? (You can search about React Props, which is what we will go over next class.)
